# The gitzilla config file.
# This file is in the ConfigParser format. This is something like:
#
# [Section_Name]
# item: value
# another_item: value2
#


# Each git repository should have its own section. The global config
# at /etc/gitzillarc MUST specify bugzilla_url, bugzilla_user and
# bugzilla_password
#
# The bugzilla_user and bugzilla_password may be overridden by user
# specific config files at ~/.gitzillarc
#
# Note that the global config would be readable by all and may contain a bugzilla
# credentials. If you think this is a problem, you may rely on per-user auth.
#
# If the user_config option is set to allow or force, then auth
# credentials are picked up from the user specific ~/.gitzillarc file.
#
# If the user_config option is force and the ~/.gitzillarc does not
# contain bugzilla credentials, then the ~/.bugz_cookie file is used for
# authentication. To generate a cookie file, a user may use the
# gitzilla-gencookie script. The cookie validity will of course be dependent
# on your Bugzilla configuration. If neither credentials nor the cookie file are
# present (and valid), Bugzilla interactions will fail and the commits will be
# rejected.
#
# If the user_config option is allow, then user specific credentials are
# used if available. Only if credentials are unavailable in both the
# user-specific as well as the systemwide configs, the cookie file is used. This
# configuration is the default because of the closeness of behaviour from version
# 1.0.
#
# The format of the user specific files is the same, and they must
# have a section for each repository to be configured.
#
# Mandatory values for /etc/gitzillarc:
#
#  * bugzilla_url
#
#
# Optional values for /etc/gitzillarc:
#
#  * bugzilla_user
#
#      the default username for Bugzilla.
#
#  * bugzilla_password
#
#      the default password for Bugzilla.
#
#  * user_config
#
#      allow/deny user specific Bugzilla credentials. The legal values
#      are: 'allow', 'deny' and 'force'. Defaulst to 'allow'.
#
#  * allowed_bug_states
#
#      a comma separated set of states that a bug must be in, in order
#      for the commit to be allowed by the update hook. If this is set,
#      working bugzilla credentials are required.
#
#  * formatspec
#
#      appended to '--format=format:' in 'git whatchanged'. See the
#      'git whatchanged' manpage for more info.
#
#  * separator
#
#      a string which would never occur in commit messages. You should
#      not need to set this, as it is already at a safe default.
#
#  * bug_regex
#
#      the (Python) regex for capturing bug numbers. MUST capture all
#      the digits of the bug id in a named group called 'bug'. This
#      regex is compiled internally with the MULTILINE, DOTALL and
#      IGNORECASE options set. The default regex captures the
#      following forms:
#          - bug 123
#          - Bug # 123
#          - BUG123
#          - bug# 123
#          - Bug #123
#
#  * logfile
#
#      the file to log to. Must be writable by the uid of the git
#      process. In case of ssh pushes, that usually means that it should
#      be writable by all.
#
#  * loglevel
#
#      can be 'info' or 'debug' - defaults to 'debug'.
#
#
#
# The user specific files are entirely optional. The only values
# they override are bugzilla_user and bugzilla_password.
#

# sample configuration:
#
# [/path/to/repository/.git]
# bugzilla_url: https://repo.example.com/bugzilla/
# bugzilla_user: foo@example.com
# bugzilla_password: barbarblah
# allowed_bug_states: NEW, ASSIGNED, REOPENED
# user_config: deny
