# The gitzilla config file.
# This file is in the ConfigParser format. This is something like:
#
# [Section_Name]
# item: value
# another_item: value2
#


# Each git repository should have it's own section. The global config
# at /etc/gitzillarc MUST specify bugzilla_url, bugzilla_user and
# bugzilla_password
#
# The bugzilla_user and bugzilla_password may be overridden by user
# specific config files at ~/.gitzillarc
#
# Note that the global config would be readable by all and is required
# to contain a username/password for bugzilla. If you think this is a
# problem, you could put in dummy values. In that case however, users
# MUST put their own credentials in their ~/.gitzillarc files if the
# update hook is being used with the allowed_bug_states option set. If
# that is not the case, users can get away by not having their
# credentials available, and their commits would not show up in bugziila
# comments.
#
# The format of the user specific files is the same, and they must
# have a section for each repository to be configured.
#
# Mandatory values for /etc/gitzillarc:
#
#  * bugzilla_url
#  * bugzilla_user
#  * bugzilla_password
#
#
# Optional values for /etc/gitzillarc:
#
#  * allowed_bug_states
#
#      a comma separated set of states that a bug must be in, in order
#      for the commit to be allowed by the update hook. If this is set,
#      working bugzilla credentials are required.
#
#  * formatspec
#
#      appended to '--format=format:' in 'git whatchanged'. See the
#      'git whatchanged' manpage for more info.
#
#  * separator
#
#      a string which would never occur in commit messages. You should
#      not need to set this, as it is already at a dafe default.
#
#  * bug_regex
#
#      the (Python) regex for capturing bug numbers. MUST capture all
#      the digits of the bug id in a named group called 'bug'. This
#      regex is compiled internally with the MULTILINE, DOTALL, and
#      IGNORECASE options set. The default regex captures the
#      following forms:
#          - bug 123
#          - Bug # 123
#          - BUG123
#          - bug# 123
#          - Bug #123
#
#  * logfile
#
#      the file to log to. Must be writable by the uid of the git
#      process. In case of ssh pushes, it usually means that it should
#      be writable by all.
#
#  * loglevel
#
#      can be 'info' or 'debug' - defaults to 'debug'.
#
#
#
# The user specific files are entirely optional. The only values
# they override are bugzilla_user and bugzilla_password.
#

# sample configuration:
#
# [/path/to/repository/.git]
# bugzilla_url: https://repo.example.com/bugzilla/
# bugzilla_user: foo@example.com
# bugzilla_password: barbarblah
