GitZilla
========

GitZilla is Python magic to support Git-Bugzilla integration. There are
various ways of using GitZilla.

Note that GitZilla must be installed on the machine receiving commits from
everyone - home to the the "official" or the "central" repository.


Usage
.....

Simple ready scripts
--------------------

To quickly start using GitZilla:

  * Install GitZilla. You may choose the .deb for easy installation on
    Debian/Ubuntu systems. Otherwise, just unpack the source and install in
    the usual setuptools way::

        sudo python setup.py install

  * Switch to the hooks directory (/path/to/repository/.git/hooks) and delete
    the ``post-receive`` and ``update`` hooks.

  * Link (or copy) the gitzilla provided hooks::

        ln -s $(which gitzilla-post-receive) post-receive
        ln -s $(which gitzilla-update) update

  * Read and edit the config file at /etc/gitzillarc

  * Commit away!


Custom GitZilla
---------------

If you need the hooks to do other stuff apart from just the Bugzilla
integration, you could write your hook as a Python script and leave the
Bugzilla stuff to one of the functions from ``gitzilla.hooks``.

In fact with the defaults, the ready scripts are equivalent to the following:

post-receive::

    #!/usr/bin/python
    from gitzilla.hooks import post_receive
    post_receive("https://repo.example.com/bugzilla", "username", "password")


update::

    #!/usr/bin/python
    from gitzilla.hooks import update
    update()

The provided ready scripts do more, but that's just parsing and picking up
values from the configuration files.

You could pass a custom bug id extraction regex and your own logging.Logger
instance. The update hook function also accepts an array of allowed bug status
strings. If that is provided, bugzilla credentials MUST be provided as well.

Look at the module help for gitzilla.hooks for more information.


Down and dirty
--------------

This is an internal-only mode for now. More info when this is stable.


Configuration
.............

GitZilla uses a global configuration file (at /etc/gitzillarc) as well as
per-user configuration files (at ~/.gitzillarc). All the configuration options
are picked up from the global config file, and the user specific config is
allowed to override **only** the ``bugzilla_user`` and ``bugzilla_password``
parameters.

The configuration files themselves are in the ConfigParser format (see
http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html). A sample configuration
looks like::

    [/path/to/repository/.git]
    bugzilla_url: https://repo.example.com/bugzilla/
    bugzilla_user: foo@example.com
    bugzilla_password: blahblah
    allowed_bug_states: NEW, ASSIGNED, REOPENED
    logfile: /var/log/gitzilla.log
    loglevel: info


Each git repository on the system MUST have its own section. The global config
MUST specify the ``bugzilla_url``, ``bugzilla_user`` and ``bugzilla_password``
parameters.

The user specific files are entirely optional.

Mandatory parameters
--------------------

  - bugzilla_url
  - bugzilla_user
  - bugzilla_password


Optional parameters
-------------------

  - allowed_bug_states

        a comma separated set of states that a bug must be in, in order for
        the commit to be allowed by the update hook. If this is set, working
        bugzilla credentials are required (see security note).

  - formatspec

        appended to ``--format=format:`` and passed to ``git whatchanged``.
        See the ``git whatchanged`` manpage for more info.

  - separator

        a string which would never occur in commit messages. You should not
        need to set this, as it is already at a safe default.

  - bug_regex

	the (Python) regex for capturing bug numbers. MUST capture all the
        digits (and only the digits) of the bug id in a named group called
	``bug``. This regex is compiled internally with the MULTILINE, DOTALL
	and IGNORECASE options set. The default regex captures from the
        following forms:

          * bug 123
          * Bug # 123
          * BUG123
          * bug# 123
          * Bug #123

  - logfile

        the file to log to. MUST be writable by the uid of the git process. In
        case of ssh pushes, tha usually means it should be writable by all.

  - loglevel

        can be ``info`` or ``debug``. Defaults to ``debug``.


Security note
-------------

Note that the global config would be readable by all and is required to
contain a username/password for bugzilla. If you think this is a problem, you
could put in dummy values. In that case however, users MUST put their own
credentials in their ~/.gitzillarc files if the update hook is being used with
the ``allowed_bug_states`` option set. If that is not the case, users can get
away by not having their credentials available, and their commits would not
show up in bugziila comments.

To summarize:

  - Either put working Bugzilla credentials in the global config. These will
    be used when the users don't provide with their own via the user specific
    files.

  - If putting in Bugzilla credentials is seen as a risk, or if the users are
    to be forced to provide their own credentials via ~/.gitzillarc, you MUST
    use the update hook with the ``allowed_bug_states`` option set to some bug
    statuses.

  - If /etc/gitzillarc does not have correct Bugzilla credentials and the
    update hook is not used with the ``allowed_bug_states`` option set, users
    who do not provide correct credentials via ~/.gitzillarc will be able to
    skip the Bugzilla comment addition step. Their commits will still be
    accepted though (depending on the update hook).


Requirements
............

To install and run GitZilla, you need:

  - Python (tested with 2.6.4, should work with >=2.5)
  - pybugz (tested with 0.8.0)

Of course, to make it useful you also need a Bugzilla installation somewhere
(not required to be on the same machine). GitZilla has been tested with
Bugzilla 3.0.11 and should work with any Bugzilla version supported by pybugz.

The excellent pybugz can be obtained from http://github.com/ColdWind/pybugz/
and http://github.com/ColdWind/pybugz/downloads/


Download
........

GitZilla is hosted at GitHub : http://github.com/gera/gitzilla

You can access the downloads at : http://github.com/gera/gitzilla/downloads

The download page contains a .deb which should work on Debian and Ubuntu
systems.
